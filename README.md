# hello-world
started creating github repository as part of preparing myself for google interview.
I am Sai. I am a software engineer who completed my engineering in Computer Science and became a successful Software Engineer. After working for 5 + years I am still feeling that emptiness which is prevalent in Software Industry.

I know I can do a technology related work but whenever I listen something new I am horrified. I am performing well in my office. I see people doing certifications I feel low. But I know I am better than them when it comes to work.

So I started preparing myself for google interview which helps me to test the market value of my brain. This is the first step  in order to acheive that.
